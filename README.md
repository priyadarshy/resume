### Work Experience

##### [Sunsama](https://sunsama.com)
_Co-Founder & CEO - San Mateo, CA & Portland, OR_  
_October 2013 to November 2015_

+ **Technologies used**: Python, NLTK, Flask, Javascript, Meteor, AWS, Git.
+ **Accomplishments**: built product, built team of 5 engineers, raised money, released product, acquired thousands of users. 
+ **E-mail AI**: Used Python/Flask/NLTK to build an e-mail AI that automatically handled inbound requests like "find a time for Joe and I to meet next week". 
+ **Scheduling Engine**: Built world's best scheduling engine for recommending available time. Accounts for arbitrary number of users, preferences, calendars, location and travel times. No other calendar/scheduling product has a scheduling engine has sophisticated as Sunsama's.
+ **Date Range Parser**: Built a custom Python library to convert text string like "between next tuesday and next Friday morning" into arrays of datetimes. Used NLP, regular expressions, and NLTK's grammar trees. 
+ **Chrome Extension**: Built a JS chrome extension that added a command bar to the GMail DOM. Allowed users to automatically schedule meetings with their email contacts. 
+ **Contact Recommendation Engine**: Built recommendation engine in python to suggest likely contacts based on contacts, mutual events, shared contacts,  shared calendar and our internal user graph.
+ **AngelList scraper**: built AngelList scraper to automate outreach to angel investors. 
+ **Lead-enrichment Project**: Scraped Slack's subdomains to get list of companies that matched a tech-stack profile we were looking for. Current products e.g. Datanyze aren't able to do this. 
+ **Slack Bot**: Built a slack integration and slack bot to perform automated outreach to user's in public slack communities. 

##### [LUMOBody Tech](https://lumobodytech.com)
_DSP and User Interaction Engineer - Palo Alto, Ca_  
_October 2011 to July 2013_

+ **Technologies used**: Matlab, ANSI-C, Python, Signal Processing, BLE, PIC Microcontroller.
+ **Accomplishments**: Built best-in-class pedometry algorithm that was used in clinical research and recruited and hired first two engineers.
+ **Pattern Recognition Module**: Wrote DSP algorithms for gait analysis and activity recognition. (Pedometry, calories, distance, impact) for the product's onboard microcontroller. Algorithms were prototyped in Matlab/Python and ported to C when ready for production. I also ported the functionality of Hidden Markov Model based prototypes to a DSP based approach to reduce computational load. 
+ **Height Detection Algorithm**: Wrote adapative (machine learning) algorithm to estimate user height from accelerometer signals.
+ **Context Adaptive Algorithms**: Built models to re-parameterize pattern recognition module's parameters based on a change in user's context e.g. location, desk, etc. 
+ **Sedentary Behavior Research**: Coordinated clinical research with Stanford university to test algorithms I developed. 
+ **Hardware/Sensor Testing**: Built custom testbeds to ensure hardware robustness and measure various signal outputs. Performed tests in office and on the production line. Significant experience in testing and using BLE based devices.
+ **Shopify/Volusion Backends**: Built Flask/Heroku backend's to perform thousands of fulfillment offers.
+ **SDK Examples**: Used the Lumoback SDK to build sample iOS apps. 

##### EEMe labs
_Founder - Mountain View, Ca_  _June 2012 to October 2013_

+ **Technologies used**: Python, Objective-C, NLTK, Cocoa, iBeacons, Location services, Twilio, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, CoreBluetooth, iBeacons.
+ **iOS App: Reachd**: [reachd](https://reachd.me) used Natural Language Processing to generate automatic,intelligent and context aware SMS responses to questions about a friend's location, ETA, etc. Built backend services and NLP logic with Python/Flask. (Previously) available in in App Store.+ **iOS App: WalkBack**: Created [WalkBack](https://walkback.me), a product for student safety while in college. (Previously) available in App store. Won SXSW's Student Startup Madness with this.+ **iOS App: YOGG**: Yogg was an experimental app that allowed you to use Siri-type location reminders for people you worked with. It understood requests like "Have Joe call me when reaches SFO." and would automatically cally both parties when Joe reached SFO.+ **APBeacons**: Built general purpose iOS libraries that mimiced all of the functionality of the iOS's built in iBeacons library but allowed transmission and discovery while apps were backgrounded which was not allowed in iBeacons. I basically re-wrote iBeacons using only CoreBluetooth. This project is ongoing. 
+ **Sales Automation Tools**: Built e-mail automation tools for cold e-mailing leads similar to SalesLoft Cadence and Outreach.io in Python.

Performed real to I/Q conversion in a computationally efficient manner to simulate channel equalization.+ **Fixed Point Filter Design**: Simulated the effects of fixed-point arithmetic to observe implementation losses in FPGA systems using Matlab/Octave's Fixed Point toolbox.
##### Aster Data Systems
_Intern in Product Development Team_

### Products Built

+ **[Sunsama](https://sunsama.com)**: Founder, led team of 5 engineers. Built
  original versions and various MVPs including an e-mail based assistant that
  auto-scheduled events. 
+ **[WalkBack](http://www.walkback.me)**: Mobile-app for student safety. [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/walkback/id625953084?mt=8)  
+ **[reachd](http://www.reachd.me)**: Context aware and auto-response SMS app. [Link](www.reachd.me)  
+ **[LUMOback](https://lumobodytech.com)**: Second full-time engineer. Wrote DSP and Machine Learning algorithms for activity recognition and health tracking. 

<a id="opensource"></a>
### Open Source Projects
+ **[APBeacons](https://github.com/priyadarshy/APBeacons)**: iOS 7 provides developers access to iBeacons. When using an iOS device as a beacon you are unable to broadcast with the app being in the background. APBeacons was designed as a workaround to this issue. APBeacons uses CoreBluetooth in both the peripheral and central mode simultaneously in order to make background broadcasting possible.
+ **[GoogleCalendarV3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GoogleCalendarV3/0.1.7)** is a python wrapper on Google Calendar's API. This was **downloaded 700 times** in the past month. 
+ **[email-att](https://github.com/priyadarshy/email-att)** is a Meteor package that let's you send e-mail with attachments, this was originally not supported in Meteor's core implementation. It currently has **504 installs**. 
+ **[APKeyboardCategories](https://github.com/priyadarshy/APKeyboardCategories)** is re Objective-C categories that add useful and common functionality that almost any text input field in an iOS app would need. 
+ **[APResponseParser](https://github.com/priyadarshy/APResponseParser)** a simple utility that allows a user to retrieve subdocuments from JSON that is arbitrarily deep without having to employ checks for Nil values at every step. This is one of the first pieces of iOS code I wrote so I asked for help improving it via public code reviews: [Stack Exchange Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/28201/pulling-objects-values-from-arbitrarily-nested-json)
+ **[AnisotropicDiffusion](https://github.com/priyadarshy/AnisotropicDiffusion)** is just a small Matlab script that performs Anisotropic Diffusion on an image. Examples show how this filtering method can clean up images of Neurons.
