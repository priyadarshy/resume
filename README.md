## Older Projects
##### CalmingTech Laboratory
_Student Researcher_  
_July 2011 - August 2011_   

+ Helped implement an algorithm to extract breath rate from accelerometer data. 

##### Biogas Systems
_Jefferson Public Citizen - Bluefields, Nicaragua_  
_January 2010 - August 2010_  

+ Gathered data and information about the use, maintenance and issues involving biogas-systems in Bluefields, Nicaragua in order to create a market for the sustainable technology.
+ Used a human-centered approach to prototype solutions that will aid in the increased use of biodigesters. 

##### Bioinformatics Project
_Undergraduate Research Project - University of Virginia_
_October 2009 - May 2010_
+ Implementation of mass-spectrometry analysis algorithm in the statistical computing language R for biomarker discovery.

##### Neural Engineering Laboratory
_Student Researcher at George Mason University_
_September 2007 to May 2008_

+ Performed electrochemical Studies of highly sensitive electrodes that interface with a rat’s brain. 

##### Galileo Sequences
_Summer student at Lynchburg College_
_July 2007 to August 2008_

+ Developed expansion of Classical Galileo Sequence Problem. 
+ We developed a formal proof for sequences similar to Galileo's with variable arithmetic gaps and also when the terms are raised to any power k. 
+ We were able to derive a general expression of the infinite expansion of binomials that expresses the value to which the sequences converges to based on the power that each term is raised to.
+ Problem Formulation published _Math Horizons_.

##### Aster Data Systems
_Intern in Product Development Team_ 			
_June 2009 – August 2009_  

+ I helped conceptualize, create and deliver multi-media content that captured concisely and in a captivating manner the essential features of the Aster nCluster. My work was invaluable in enhancing the market reach and appeal of Aster's product. In the process I gained experience working with massively-parallel databases, MapReduce, and data analysis. 

##### General Dynamics: Advanced Information Systems  
_Student Participant_
_September 2007 - May 2008_  

+ Developed software for a Sonar Tactical Simulator working in a small team of four students. We made extensive use of UML diagrams and the Model-View-Controller design pattern before implementing the simulator in the Java language.
