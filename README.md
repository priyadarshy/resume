### Ashutosh Priyadarshy

##### Objective:
Looking for a software position where I can code, talk to customers, and work
with and/or lead engineering teams. 

Things I enjoy and keep me motivated:  

+ Software problems where I  apply my background in electrical engineering, signal processing and applied mathematics.  
+ Automating mundane business/information retreival tasks with scripts and web scrapers.  
+ Software where I'm only one hop away from the user.

##### Galileo Sequences
_Summer student at Lynchburg College_
_July 2007 to August 2008_

+ Developed expansion of Classical Galileo Sequence Problem. 
+ We developed a formal proof for sequences similar to Galileo's with variable arithmetic gaps and also when the terms are raised to any power k. 
+ We were able to derive a general expression of the infinite expansion of binomials that expresses the value to which the sequences converges to based on the power that each term is raised to.
+ Problem Formulation published _Math Horizons_.

My work was invaluable in enhancing the market reach and appeal of Aster's product. In the process I gained experience working with massively-parallel databases, MapReduce, and data analysis. 

##### General Dynamics: Advanced Information Systems  
_Student Participant_
_September 2007 - May 2008_  

+ Developed software for a Sonar Tactical Simulator working in a small team of four students. We made extensive use of UML diagrams and the Model-View-Controller design pattern before implementing the simulator in the Java language.
