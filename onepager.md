## Work Experience

##### Sunsama
_Co-Founder - San Mateo, CA & Portland, OR_  
_October 2013 to November 2015_

+ Built initial team of 5 engineers to build a "team based calendar"
+ Used Meteor, Python, NLTK, Flask, AWS Daily
+ Raised Angel funding.
+ Performed outbound sales and customer conversations. 
+ Used Python/Flask/NLTK to build an e-mail "AI" that automatically handled
  requests like "find a time for Joe and I to meet next week". 
+ Built the "scheduling engine" algorithms which takes an arbitrary number of users,
  calendars, preferences and returns good times to meet while accounting for
  travel times and location.
+ Built a chrome extension that scheduled meetings similar to "Assitant.to"
+ Built various scrapers to automate tasks like investor outreach, potential customer outreach. 

##### LUMOBody Tech
_DSP and User Interaction Engineer - Palo Alto, Ca_  
_October 2011 to July 2013_

+ Wrote DSP algorithms for gait analysis and activity recognition. (Pedometry, calories, distance, impact). 
+ Wrote machine learning algorithm to estimate user height from accelerometer signals.
+ Helped transition algorithms from Hidden Markov Models to a DSP approach to reduce computational load on-board.
+ Coordinated clinical research with Stanford university to test algorithms I
  developed. 
+ Performed hardware testing pre-production, during production runs and
  post-production. 

##### Virginia Image and Video Analysis  
_Student Researcher at the University of Virginia_  
_September 2011 to May 2012_ 

+ Developed MATLAB simulator for Differential InSAR to model sinkholes.
+ Image Segmentation and clustering of Highly Confluent Bovine Endothileal cells.
+ Taught iOS development to lab group.

##### United States Naval Research Laboratory
_Intern in Tactical Electronic Warfare Division - Washington, D.C._  
_June 2010 to January 2011_

+ Developed code for a radar and missile simulator built in modern C++ with Boost. 
+ Re-implemented many of MATLAB's Digital filtering functions in C++.
+ Created HDF5 data store for simulation data.

##### Azure Summit Technology
_Intern in Electronic Warfare - Fairfax, Va_  
_June 2011 to August 2011_

+ Simulation and implementation of the Cognitive-Radio, Electronic Warfare adaptive polyphase-channelizer used forinterference cancellation, highly efficient signal reconstruction and anti-jam tactics.+ Extensive applications of multi-rate signal processing, filter bank theory, time-frequency analysis and DSP.+ Performed real to I/Q conversion in a computationally efficient manner to simulate channel equalization.+ Simulated the effects of fixed-point arithmetic to observe implementation losses in FPGA systems.
##### EEMe labs
_Founder - Mountain View, Ca_  _June 2012 to October 2013_
+ Built [reachd](www.reachd.me). Using Natural Language Processing to generate automatic,intelligent and context aware SMS responses to questions about user's location. (Previously) available in in App Store.+ Created WalkBack, a product for student safety while in college. (Previously) available in App store.
+ Built e-mail automation tools for cold e-mailing leads similar to SalesLoft Cadence and Outreach.io.
